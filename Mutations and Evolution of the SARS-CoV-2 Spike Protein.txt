COVID-19 has become a public health concern around the world. The frequency of N440K variant was higher during the second wave in South India. The mutation was observed in the Receptor Binding Domain region (RBD) of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S) protein. The binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2-Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE-2) plays a major role in the transmission and severity of the disease. To understand the binding affinity of the wild and mutant SARS-CoV-2 S with ACE2, molecular modeling studies were carried out. We discovered that the wild SARS-CoV-2 S RBD-ACE-2 complex has a high binding affinity and stability than that of the mutant. The N440K strain escapes from antibody neutralization, which might increase reinfection and decrease vaccine efficiency. To find a potential inhibitor against mutant N440K SARS-CoV-2, a virtual screening process was carried out and found ZINC169293961, ZINC409421825 and ZINC22060839 as the best binding energy compounds.

4. Mutations of the S1 Subunit Containing the Receptor-Binding Domain
Due to the role of the RBD in ACE2 recognition and binding, it stands to reason that changes in the amino acid sequence of RBD can dramatically impact S binding affinity for ACE2 and, ultimately, SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. This is reflected by the fact that while mutations occur throughout this region, most of them are located on the surface of S (Figure 3a), allowing for direct interactions with potential ligands (Figure 3b,c). A 2020 deep mutational analysis conducted by Starr et al. screened for alterations of human ACE2 affinity that occurred as a result of single-site mutations within this region [21]. Comparing the results of this study to variants of concern that have arisen as of March 2022 (Figure 3a), among sixteen mutations that contributed to reduce the neutralization of the mutant viruses by post-vaccinated sera, only seven likely conferred increased binding affinity of S for ACE2 (G339D, N440K, L452R, S477N, T478K, E484K, and N501Y). These data suggest that binding affinity between S and the host receptor is not the predominant factor contributing to the positive selection of mutations within the RBD [21]. Polymorphism of ACE2 is rare (mean Fst 0.0167), with alterations hypothesized as modifying RBD-ACE2 affinity being exceedingly uncommon, even within this subset [22]. An alternative explanation for positive selection of mutations within the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 is enhancement of resistance to postvaccinated sera [24]. Studies testing monoclonal antibodies isolated from SARS-CoV-2-vaccinated individuals have demonstrated resistance conferred by nearly all RBD mutations [19,25,26,27,28] (Figure 3d). This is not surprising as 40% of the antibodies produced against SARS-CoV-2 target the RBD, and the vast majority of these antibodies are neutralizing antibodies [29]. Additionally, the majority of mutations within this region alter either the charge or hydrophobicity of the RBD, dramatically increasing the probability of antibody escape via modified epitope affinity or local conformational changes decreasing epitope accessibility. An interesting exception to this trend of individual mutations showing increasing resistance to postvaccinated sera is represented by the G496A substitution, though this may be due to this mutation being fairly recent and data on its effects being limited at this time. Taken together, it can be inferred that the primary driver of positive selection arising from the majority of mutations within the RBD is enhanced neutralization resistance as opposed to increased affinity of S to ACE2.
Thirteen of the sixteen RBD mutations associated with VOCs are found within the Omicron variant, ten of which exclusively occur in the defining sequence of Omicron. A popular theory for the sudden appearance of these mutations (many of which reduce ACE2 affinity) is that the Omicron strain evolved in an immunocompromised patient, thereby reducing selective pressure and allowing for multiple concurrent mutations as the strain developed [30]. This theory is further supported by the strain first being identified in an immunocompromised patient in South Africa [30]. An alternate theory for the sudden appearance of this multitude of mutations is the occurrence of zoonosis. Five of the defining Omicron mutations (K417, E484, Q493, Q498, and N501) are commonly found in mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 strains, suggesting that the strain may have initially developed in animal species (for example, murine) and then was transmitted to and further evolved within the human population [31]. These observations demonstrate the possibility that not all individual COVID-19 mutations arise as a result of normal selective pressures, but may occur as the culmination of net-positive concurrent mutations that arise under atypical conditions.
5. Mutations of the S1 Subunit N-Terminal Domain
The reasons for the positive selection of variants bearing mutations within the NTD of SARS-CoV-2 S are multifaceted, with common mutations occurring throughout the NTD subdomain (Figure 4a,b). Though 35% of antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 target the NTD, only about one-third of these antibodies have a neutralizing effect [29]. Further investigation of neutralizing antibodies targeting NTD have revealed a “supersite” to which nearly all of these antibodies bind [32]. An interesting hallmark of antibodies targeting the NTD region is their ability to decrease cell–cell fusion, suggesting that the NTD may play a role in syncytium formation [32]. Fourteen of the eighteen mutations that occur in the NTD of VOCs occur within close proximity (eights angstroms) of this antigenic supersite (Figure 4c). Taken together with the fact that many of these mutations occur within the Omicron variant (which appeared only after vaccinations became widely distributed), it is possible that resistance to neutralizing antibodies (particularly those found in postvaccinated sera) targeting the NTD play a large role in the positive selection for SARS-CoV-2 [33].Though they do not occur near the NTD neutralization “supersite”, T95I and Δ69–70 occur in almost one-quarter of all sequenced genomes and are indicators of the highly successful Omicron variant, which has demonstrated a clear fitness advantage, suggesting positive selection for these mutations. Analysis of Δ69–70 in pseudoviral models revealed a substantial ability for this mutation set to increase infectivity [34]. Further analysis demonstrated that this increase is primarily mediated by enhancement of cell–cell fusion, while simultaneously having little to no effect on neutralization by NTD-neutralizing antibodies [34]. Similarly, analysis of metadata for qPCR cycling thresholds obtained from patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 showed an increase in viral load for patients with variants bearing the T95I mutation, especially in the presence of Δ142 [35]. Structural modelling additionally revealed topological changes that may occur in the NTD “supersite” as a result of T95I, suggesting that it is possible for other mutant residues, even if they are not in the supersite region, to alter the topology of the supersite and affect SARS-CoV-2 neutralization by postvaccinated sera [35].
6. Other S1 Mutations and Mutations Occurring between S1 and S2
Mutations that occur outside of major subdomains such as the NTD and RBD also heavily influence SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and/or sensitivity to sera from convalescent and/or vaccinated individuals. Although they do not occur in major subdomains, all residues within this region substantially alter local charge and/or hydrophobicity, qualities that greatly increase the likelihood of modifying local protein structure and, ultimately, function. This observation suggests that these mutations have arisen as a result of positive selection as opposed to random genetic drift.
D614G is the most ubiquitous of all known SARS-CoV-2 mutations of the S protein, having occurred in over 99% of all sequenced cases of COVID-19 as of 2022 (Figure 5a). While D614G does not occur firmly within any particular subdomain (Figure 5b,c), it seems to have an effect on multiple aspects of the S protein. Initial pseudoviral models for infection demonstrated that D614G greatly enhances SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, likely resulting from increased incorporation of S into the SARS-CoV-2 virion [36]. Further analysis of D614G demonstrated that the mutation alters the conformation of the RBD, increasing its occurrence in an “up” state that enhances the binding affinity between S and ACE2, as well as increasing S accessibility by furin [37].As the pandemic has progressed, mutations at P681 have emerged in the majority of sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes. These mutations are particularly interesting as they occur in a 10-residue stretch from amino acids 680–689, which comprise the furin cleavage site which develops during viral particle production. Structural modeling of P681 mutations have demonstrated that alterations at this site are capable of increasing furin cleavage [38]. In pseudoviral models, only P681R has been demonstrated to independently increase cellular infectivity via furin cleavage, while P681H does not appear to significantly impact either furin cleavage or viral infectivity independently [39,40]. The A570D mutation may also impact furin cleavage, with structural analysis of this alteration showing an increase in the spacing between individual chains of S trimer (brought about by drastic changes in both charge and hydrophobicity), potentially enhancing furin accessibility [41]. Pseudoviral testing of the A570D was unable to demonstrate that the mutation can independently increase infectivity, with the mutation destabilizing the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirion [42]. This finding indicates that positive selection of A570D may occur as a result of interaction with coinciding mutations that are known to stabilize SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirions (such as D950N and D1118H) [42].
7. Mutations of the S2 Subunit
The mechanisms through which mutations within the S2 subunit affect SARS-CoV-2 infectivity are potentially diverse, with the S2 subunit containing five subdomains, each having a distinct function. Only four mutations within the S2 region occur commonly in SARS-CoV-2 VOCs other than the recent Omicron strain (and are therefore better researched): T716I, D950N, S982A, and D1118H (Figure 6a). Two of these three mutations (D950N and S982A) lie within the HR1 domain, suggesting that alterations within this region may be particularly prone to driving positive selection (Figure 6b). This positive selection may occur by altering the association of HR1 with HR2, the possibility of which is further enhanced when considering that both mutations substantially alter either the charge or hydrophobicity at these sites. Structural analysis of the region between the heptad repeat domains (where D1118H occurs) showed that residues within this region play an important role in repositioning the S2 domain postfusion, allowing for the heptad repeat domains to interact with the targeted cell membrane [43].The S982A substitution increases the presentation of the “up” RBD state by eliminating the interaction with T547, which stabilizes the “down” RBD state. This change in RBD state is partially counteracted by the complementary A570D mutation that occurs in the Alpha SARS-CoV-2 variant [44]. It was demonstrated that the D570 residue is capable of forming an interprotomer hydrogen bond with N856, effectively re-establishing the bond that stabilizes this “down” confirmation [44]. Within the S trimer, when D1118H mutation occurs, the three histidine residues (one from each monomeric S) form a histidine triad within the trimer, stabilizing the overall structure of the trimeric S complex [45]. Although there is, as yet, no direct evidence of the role this stabilization plays, it was suggested that this effect may compensate for local destabilizations caused by associated mutations such as T716I [44]. The concurrence of these conflicting mutations within the same variants indicates that there is likely a balancing act between maintaining S stability and allowing for the switching between various conformations in the pre- and postfusion states.

The spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is critical for virus infection through the engagement of the human ACE2 protein1 and is a major antibody target. Here we show that chronic infection with SARS-CoV-2 leads to viral evolution and reduced sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies in an immunosuppressed individual treated with convalescent plasma, by generating whole-genome ultra-deep sequences for 23 time points that span 101 days and using in vitro techniques to characterize the mutations revealed by sequencing. There was little change in the overall structure of the viral population after two courses of remdesivir during the first 57 days. However, after convalescent plasma therapy, we observed large, dynamic shifts in the viral population, with the emergence of a dominant viral strain that contained a substitution (D796H) in the S2 subunit and a deletion (ΔH69/ΔV70) in the S1 N-terminal domain of the spike protein, as passively transferred serum antibodies diminished, viruses with the escape genotype were reduced in frequency, before returning during a final, unsuccessful course of convalescent plasma treatment. In vitro, the spike double mutant bearing both ΔH69/ΔV70 and D796H conferred modestly decreased sensitivity to convalescent plasma, while maintaining infectivity levels that were similar to the wild-type virus.The spike substitution mutant D796H appeared to be the main contributor to the decreased susceptibility to neutralizing antibodies, but this mutation resulted in an infectivity defect. The spike deletion mutant ΔH69/ΔV70 had a twofold higher level of infectivity than wild-type SARS-CoV-2, possibly compensating for the reduced infectivity of the D796H mutation. These data reveal strong selection on SARS-CoV-2 during convalescent plasma therapy, which is associated with the emergence of viral variants that show evidence of reduced susceptibility to neutralizing antibodies in immunosuppressed individuals.

Recent reports suggest that Omicron BA.2 causes more antibody evasion than BA.1 owing to the additional S371F, T376A, D405N and R408S substitution.81, 82 It has been reported that BA.2 exhibited marked resistance to 17 of 19 neutralising mAbs tested.81 Interestingly, even Sotrovimab that had appreciable effects against BA.1, lost 27-fold neutralising activity against BA.2.81 A study, however, reported that the mAb cocktail Evusheld (Cilagavimab and Tixagevimab) can neutralise BA.2 better than BA.1.83 Another research study reported that reduction in neutralising capacity of mAbs against Omicron BA.2 was less compared to BA.1 and BA.3,84 suggesting that the neutralisation could also depend upon individual mAbs, and might be too soon to predict if BA.2 is more resistant to antibodies than BA.1. The new Omicron sublineages- BA.4 and BA.5- have been reported to impart even higher resistance against the broad mAbs than BA.1 and BA.2.85, 86 Pseudoviruses harbouring the spike of these newer Omicron variants (BA.4 and BA.5) were tested for their neutralisation sensitivity against a range of therapeutic mAbs. Most of the mAbs tested failed to neutralise BA.4 and BA.5; however, interestingly these variants were more sensitive to sotrovimab than BA.2.85 Cao et. al. suggested that, with the exception of Babtelovimab and Cilgavimab, the subvariants BA.4 and BA.5 are resistant to most broad nAbs.86 These findings have been similarly reported in other studies.70 The evasion is attributed to several substitions, in particular, S371F, D405N, R408S, F486 and L452R.

Antibody evasion by convergent variants First, we tested the antibody evasion capability of these convergent variants. We constructed the VSV-based spike-pseudotyped virus of Omicron BA.2, BA.2.75, and BA.4/5 sublineages carrying those convergent mutations and examined the neutralizing activities of therapeutic neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against them (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 2a). In total, pseudoviruses of 50 convergent variants were constructed and tested. COV2-2196+COV2-2130 (Evusheld) 25 is vulnerable to F486, R346, and K444-G446 mutations, evaded or highly impaired by BJ.1 (R346T), XBB (R346T+V445P+F486S), BA.2.75.2/CA.1/BM.1.1/BM.1.1.1/CH.1.1 (R346T+F486S), CJ.1/XBF (R346T+F486P), BR.2/BR.2.1 (R346T+F486I), BA.4.6.1 (R346T+F486V), BA.5.6.2/BQ.1 (K444T+F486V), BU.1 (K444M+F486V), and BQ.1.1 (R346T+K444T+F486V). LY-CoV1404 (Bebtelovimab) remains potent against BF.16 (K444R) and BA.5.5.1 (N450D) and shows reduced potency against BA.5.1.12 (V445A) 26 79 (Extended Data Fig. 2a). However, LY-CoV1404 was escaped by BJ.1, XBB, BR.1, CH.1.1, BA.4.6.3 and BQ.1.1 while exhibiting strongly reduced activity against BA.2.38.1, BA.5.6.2, and BQ.1 due to K444N/T mutations and the combination of K444M/G446S or V445P/G446S SA55+SA58 is a pair of broad NAbs isolated from vaccinated SARS convalescents that target non-competing conserved epitopes 2, SA58 is weak to G339H and R346T mutations and showed reduced neutralization efficacy against BJ.1/XBB and BA.2.75 sublineages. SA55 is the only NAb demonstrating high potency against all tested Omicron subvariants. Among the tested variants, XBB and BQ.1.1 exhibited the strongest resistance to therapeutic mAbs and cocktails (Fig. 2a). Since the SA55+SA58 cocktail is still in preclinical development, the efficacy of available antibody drugs, including the BA.2.75/BA.5-effective Evusheld and Bebtelovimab, are extensively affected by the emerging subvariants with convergent mutations.

The newly emerged BA.2.75 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variant contains 9 additional mutations in its spike (S) protein compared to the ancestral BA.2 variant. Here, we examine the neutralizing antibody escape of BA.2.75 in mRNA-vaccinated and BA.1-infected individuals, as well as the molecular basis underlying functional changes in S. Notably, BA.2.75 exhibits enhanced neutralization resistance over BA.2 but less than the BA.4/5 variant. The G446S and N460K mutations of BA.2.75 are primarily responsible for its enhanced resistance to neutralizing antibodies. The R493Q mutation, a reversion to the prototype sequence, reduces BA.2.75 neutralization resistance. The impact of these mutations is consistent with their locations in common neutralizing antibody epitopes. Further, BA.2.75 shows enhanced cell-cell fusion over BA.2, driven largely by the N460K mutation, which enhances S processing. Structural modeling reveals enhanced receptor contacts introduced by N460K, suggesting a mechanism of potentiated receptor utilization and syncytia formation.

Several aforementioned point mutants (R346T, N460K, and F486S) had been observed in prior SARS-CoV-2 variants, and their impact on mAb binding have been reported. We therefore conducted structural modeling to understand the impact of the newly identified point mutants (Q183E, K444T, V445P, and F490S) on the binding of select mAbs . The Q183E mutation in XBB and XBB.1 disrupted the hydrogen bond that residue A32 of mAb C1520 has with the spike and caused a steric clash with residue W91, likely abrogating the binding of this mAb . K444T, found in BQ.1 and BQ.1.1, impaired the neutralization activities of most of the class 3 mAbs tested , probably because mutating lysine to threonine made the side chain shorter and uncharged, which in turn would impair the interactions of this residue with mAbs directed to this site, as can be seen with SP1-77 and LY-CoV1404 . Similarly, the V445P substitution in XBB and XBB.1 could exert an equivalent effect as K444T, by causing steric hindrance and/or disrupting a hydrogen bond with mAbs, resulting in the loss of antibody neutralization. Finally, F490S impaired the neutralizing activities of XGv282, which can be accounted for by the abolition of a cation-π interaction.

Spike Protein NTD mutation G142D in SARS-CoV-2 Delta VOC lineages is associated with frequent back mutations, increased viral-loads, and immune-evasion.

The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, which in addition to increased transmission rates, might be less sensitive to neutralizing antibodies and challenges the health systems worldwide. The ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 requires the constant characterization of emerging mutations with regard to the efficacy of neutralizing mAbs. For the Alpha variant, which became dominant in late 2020, it could be shown that the N501Y substitution in S is associated with higher affinity for the ACE2 receptor and higher transmissibility [2,25,26,27]. Nevertheless, the neutralizing ability of Alpha by convalescent sera or BNT162b2 was preserved towards authentic viruses [10,14]. The global displacement of Alpha and the dominance of Delta since spring 2021 shifted the focus towards L452R-carrying variants Epsilon and in particular the lineage B.1.617. In this study, we observed a reduced sensitivity of variants carrying L452R towards convalescent and vaccine-elicited sera that was further diminished by substitutions at E484 and T478K in S, respectively (Figure 1). Hence, the B.1.617 lineage (Kappa and Delta) exhibited a stronger immune escape relative to Epsilon.

The potential effect of the S:D178H mutation on immunity and vaccine “escape” also warrant further analysis. Mutations in the Spike N-terminal domain have been associated with a lack of neutralization by NTD directed antibodies, especially when the N5 loop is affected [18,19]. The NTD initiates viral binding to the ACE2 receptor-expressing host cell. Since the D178H falls in the NTD domain close to the N5 loop, it may alter NTD structure and antibody recognition. It may thus have a similar immune evasion effect as the HV69-70del and Y144del mutations [20], or it may further enhance that of the two other mutations, based on the 3D model. These findings highlight the continued importance of active genomic surveillance to monitor the spread of this B.1.1.7-M:V70L-S:178H lineage.

Against XBB and XBB.1, 19 of 23 mAbs lost neutralizing activity greatly or completely. Only C1717, S3H3, S309 (sotrovimab), and 10-40 showed relatively little fold change in neutralizing activity against these two subvariants relative to BA.2, although we note that these mAbs, with the exception of S3H3, had already lost significant activity against BA.2 relative to D614G (Figure S2). The Q183E mutation contributed to the activity loss of C1520; N460K and F486S accounted for the resistance to the RBD class 1 and class 2 mAbs; and R346T, V455P, G446S, and F490S contributed to the resistance to the RBD class 3 mAbs. Again, the clinically authorized LY-CoV1404 (bebtelovimab) and Evusheld could not neutralize XBB or XBB.1.

We next assessed the impact of the mutations in R.1 on antibody neutralization by using vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based pseudovirus containing all four signature mutations (W152L, S255F, E484K, and G769V), termed NJΔ4. The mutant virus, in parallel with the wild-type (WT) (D614G) virus, was subjected to neutralization by 18 MAbs, including 5 with emergency use authorization (EUA), 20 convalescent-phase plasma samples, and 22 serum samples from vaccinated individuals. The specifics of these MAbs and clinical specimens were previously reported (10, 11). As shown in Fig. 4A (left panel) and Fig. S2A, the neutralizing activity of LY-CoV555 was completely abolished against R.1 and the activity of REGN10933 was also impaired, while the other three MAbs (REGN10987, CB6, and S309) with EUA retained their activities. We next tested the neutralizing activities of seven additional receptor binding domain (RBD) MAbs. The neutralizing activities of the two potent MAbs targeting the receptor binding motif, C121 and 2-15, were markedly or completely lost against R.1, while others retained their activities (Fig. 4A, middle panel, and Fig. S2A). These findings on R.1 mimic those observed for B.1.526 with the E484K mutation (12), indicating that the E484K mutation contributed to the lost-activities of these RBD-directed MAbs. We then assessed the neutralizing activity of seven NTD MAbs against the R.1 pseudovirus (Fig. 4A, right panel, and Fig. S2B) (13). R.1 was profoundly resistant to neutralization by four NTD antibodies: 4-8, 4-19, 4A8, and 5-7, while the other three, 5-24, 4-18, and 2-17, remained active against R.1. To understand the specific mutations responsible for the observed pattern of neutralization, we then tested these NTD MAbs against a panel of pseudoviruses, each containing only a single NTD mutation found in R.1 (Fig. S2B). For the two NTD mutations, S255F contributed to the loss-activity of 4-8, 4-19, and 5-7, while W152L only partially accounted for the loss of activity of 4-19 and 5-7.

Most known SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies (nAbs), including those approved by the FDA for emergency use, inhibit viral infection by targeting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein. Variants of concern (VOC) carrying mutations in the RBD or other regions of S reduce the effectiveness of many nAbs and vaccines by evading neutralization. Therefore, therapies that are less susceptible to resistance are urgently needed. Here, we characterized the memory B-cell repertoire of COVID-19 convalescent donors and analyzed their RBD and non-RBD nAbs. We found that many of the non-RBD-targeting nAbs were specific to the N-terminal domain (NTD). Using neutralization assays with authentic SARS-CoV-2 and a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus carrying SARS-CoV-2 S protein (rVSV-SARS2), we defined a panel of potent RBD and NTD nAbs. Next, we used a combination of neutralization-escape rVSV-SARS2 mutants and a yeast display library of RBD mutants to map their epitopes. The most potent RBD nAb competed with hACE2 binding and targeted an epitope that includes residue F490. The most potent NTD nAb epitope included Y145, K150, and W152. As seen with some of the natural VOC, the neutralization potencies of COVID-19 convalescent-phase sera were reduced by 4- to 16-fold against rVSV-SARS2 bearing Y145D, K150E, or W152R spike mutations. Moreover, we found that combining RBD and NTD nAbs did not enhance their neutralization potential. Notably, the same combination of RBD and NTD nAbs limited the development of neutralization-escape mutants in vitro, suggesting such a strategy may have higher efficacy and utility for mitigating the emergence of VOC.

C.37 contains a novel deletion (S: Δ246 to 252, located at the N-terminal domain) plus seven nonsynonymous mutations in the Spike gene (G75V, T76I, D253N, L452Q, F490S, D614G, T859N) (Fig. 1C). Mutations L452Q and F490S both map to the Spike protein’s receptor-binding domain (RBD). While L452Q is almost exclusive to C.37, L452R is present in variant of concern (VOC) delta (B.1.617.2) and variants of interest (VOI) epsilon (B.1.427/B.1.429) and kappa (B.1.617.1) and is associated with increased affinity for the ACE2 receptor (2). F490S has been associated with reduced in vitro susceptibility to antibody neutralization (3, 4). C.37 also displays the ORF1a Δ3675 to 3677 deletion, found in VOCs alpha, beta, and gamma (5).

We also investigated the impact of new point mutations found in BA.2.75 on serum antibody evasion by conducting serum neutralization assays with pseudoviruses containing each point mutation in the background of BA.2 (Figure 1B). The mutations W152R, F157L, I210V, G257S, D339H, and N446K each only slightly (0.8- to 1.3-fold) altered the neutralization titers of sera from all three cohorts against BA.2. By contrast, K147E and N460K impaired the neutralization activity of sera significantly, by 1.6- to 1.8-fold and 1.5- to 2.4-fold, respectively, whereas the R493Q reversion mutation modestly enhanced the neutralization by 1.8- to 3.0-fold, as was observed previously (Wang et al., 2022b).

SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, continues to evolve. A subvariant of SARS-CoV-2 omicron (B.1.1.529), known as BA.4.6, emerged in March, 2022, and it appears to be expanding its coverage even in the presence of BA.5, the globally dominant subvariant in recent months (appendix p 2).1,  2 Compared with subvariants BA.4 and BA.5 (hereafter referred to as BA.4/5), BA.4.6 contains two additional mutations, R346T and N658S, in the spike protein (appendix p 2). Three other nascent omicron subvariants with similar spike mutations, BA.4.7 with R346S, BA.5.9 with R346I, and BF.7 with R346T, have also been detected, although at very low frequencies (appendix p 2). The fact that these four new subvariants all have mutations at the R346 residue raises concerns for further antibody evasion, because R346K in a previous subvariant of omicron (BA.1.1) impaired the potency of several therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs).

The Variant of Concern (VOC)-202012/01 (also known as B.1.1.7) is a rapidly growing lineage of SARS-CoV-2. In January 2021, VOC-202012/01 constituted about 80% of SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced in England and was present in 27 out of 29 countries that reported at least 50 viral genomes. As this strain will likely spread globally towards fixation, it is important to monitor its molecular evolution. Based on GISAID data we systematically estimated growth rates of mutations acquired by the VOC lineage to find that L18F substitution in viral spike protein has initiated a substrain characterized by replicative advantage of 1.70 [95% CI: 1.56–1.96] in relation to the remaining VOC-202012/01 substrains. The L18F mutation is of significance because when recently analyzed in the context of the South African strain 501Y.V2 it has been found to compromise binding of neutralizing antibodies. We additionally indicate three mutations that were acquired by VOC-202012/01 in the receptor binding motif of spike, specifically E484K, F490S, and S494P, that may also give rise to escape mutants. Such mutants may hinder efficiency of existing vaccines and expand in response to the increasing after-infection or vaccine-induced seroprevalence.

Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been concern about novel SARS-CoV-2 mutations emerging that are more transmissible. Recently, multiple novel strains of SARS-CoV-2 have been found to share the same deletion of amino acids H69del and V70del in the virus S gene, at least some of these strains are hypothesized to have increased transmissibility, and some have been found to infect both minks and humans1,2. This includes strain B.1.1.7 / SARS-CoV-2 VUI 202012/01, which has been found to be more infectious than other strains of SARS-CoV-2, and its increasing presence has resulted in new lockdowns in and travel restrictions leaving the UK 3–5. The B.1.1.7 strain has not yet been found in the United States, but viral sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 for surveillance purposes has been very limited and performed on only a relatively small number of samples.

Importantly, mutations at K417 are reported to escape neutralization from mAbs, including the recently approved mAb LY-CoV01622,25. Out of the 60 mAbs tested, 20 (33.3%) showed >10 fold loss of neutralising activity of TM mutant compared to WT SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 4 a–b and Extended Data Fig. 5), and of these 19 are RBM-specific mAbs. As above, we addressed the role of E484K mutation in escape from RBM-specific antibodies, by testing the binding of 50 RBD-specific mAbs to WT and E484K mutant RBD by biolayer interferometry (Fig. 4f and Extended Data Fig. 7). Out of the 19 RBM-specific mAbs that showed reduced or loss of neutralization of TM mutant (Fig. 4d), 16 showed a complete or partial loss of binding to E484K RBD mutant (Fig. 4g–h), consistent with findings that E484K is an important viral escape mutation26, 39, 27. Three of these 16 mAbs also lost binding to an RBD carrying N501Y, indicating that a fraction of RBM antibodies are sensitive to both N501Y and E484K mutations. Similarly, 3 of the 19 mAbs that lost neutralization of TM mutant (S2D8, S2H7 and S2X128) were previously shown to lose binding and neutralization to the K417V mutant, and here shown to be sensitive to either N501Y or E484K mutations.

SARS-CoV-2 variants of interest and concern will continue to emerge for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. To map mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein that affect binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, we applied in vitro evolution to affinity-mature the RBD. Multiple rounds of random mutagenic libraries of the RBD were sorted against decreasing concentrations of ACE2, resulting in the selection of higher affinity RBD binders. We found that mutations present in more transmissible viruses (S477N, E484K and N501Y) were preferentially selected in our high-throughput screen. Evolved RBD mutants include prominently the amino acid substitutions found in the RBDs of B.1.620, B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B1.351 (Beta) and P.1 (Gamma) variants.

Antibodies in group E (for example, S309)6 and group F (for example, CR3022)7, which often exhibit broad sarbecovirus neutralizing activity, are less affected by Omicron, but a subset of neutralizing antibodies are still escaped by G339D, N440K and S371L. Furthermore, Omicron pseudovirus neutralization showed that neutralizing antibodies that sustained single mutations could also be escaped, owing to multiple synergetic mutations on their epitopes. In total, over 85% of the tested neutralizing antibodies were escaped by Omicron.

Recent studies have revealed the unique virological characteristics of Omicron, the newest SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern, such as pronounced resistance to vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies, less efficient cleavage of the spike protein, and poor fusogenicity. However, it remains unclear which mutation(s) in the spike protein determine the virological characteristics of Omicron. Here, we show that the representative characteristics of the Omicron spike are determined by its receptor-binding domain. Interestingly, the molecular phylogenetic analysis revealed that the acquisition of the spike S375F mutation was closely associated with the explosive spread of Omicron in the human population. We further elucidate that the F375 residue forms an interprotomer pi-pi interaction with the H505 residue in another protomer in the spike trimer, which confers the attenuated spike cleavage efficiency and fusogenicity of Omicron. Our data shed light on the evolutionary events underlying Omicron emergence at the molecular level.

Three of them (Q493R, Q498R, and Y505H) are uniquely adapted to mouse ACE2.
